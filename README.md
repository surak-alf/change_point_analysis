## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to:
- Analyze historical Brent oil prices (1987â€“2022) to detect significant change points.
- Correlate price changes with major global events (e.g., conflicts, economic sanctions, OPEC decisions).
- Build advanced time series models (e.g., ARIMA, GARCH, LSTM) to forecast oil prices.
- Develop an interactive dashboard to visualize trends, forecasts, and event impacts.

## Features

### Data Analysis
- **Change Point Detection**: Identify significant shifts in oil prices using statistical methods.
- **Time Series Modeling**: Use ARIMA, GARCH, and LSTM models to analyze and forecast prices.
- **Event Correlation**: Correlate price changes with major global events.

### Interactive Dashboard
- **Backend**: Flask API to serve data and model outputs.
- **Frontend**: React-based interface with interactive visualizations (e.g., line charts, event highlights).
- **Key Features**:
  - Filter data by date range.
  - Highlight specific events and their impact on prices.
  - Display model performance metrics (e.g., RMSE, MAE).
